# DJ-FIT

### Introduction
Many gym members have different preferences, medical needs, time availabilities, and goals that must be taken into account when creating
a fitness program. Developing a personal workout routine that works best for you isn't as easy as it sounds. DJ FIT is the solution to 
this problem. The goal of DJ FIT is to allow fitness trainers and gym members to work together and create a customized experience that
tailors to individual needs. Workout routines can be created and structured using the application. Created routines will be stored on
a online database so that users can retrieve their workout routine and trainers can look at them for reference. DJ FIT will provide 
information on specific exercises and contain instructional videos to aid both trainers and members alike. The application can be used by 
trainers to provide customers with a user-friendly way to access information about their personal fitness program on the go.
